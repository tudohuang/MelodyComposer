# MelodyComposer ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to **MelodyComposer**, a web-based tool designed to help you create, edit, and play melodies using a virtual piano, and generate Arduino code to bring your music to life on a buzzer! Whether you're a musician, an Arduino enthusiast, or just curious about combining music with hardware, MelodyComposer makes the process fun and accessible.

## Features

- **Virtual Piano**: Compose melodies using an intuitive piano interface with keyboard shortcuts.
- **Real-Time Playback**: Preview your creations instantly with customizable waveforms (sine, square, etc.) and tempo (BPM).
- **Editable Examples**: Explore and modify preloaded melodies like Super Mario and Twinkle Twinkle.
- **Arduino Code Generation**: Export your melodies as Arduino-compatible code using `melody[]` and `durations[]` arrays.
- **Comprehensive Docs**: Step-by-step guides to help you from composition to hardware playback.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start using MelodyComposer:

### 1. Access the App
- Visit the live demo at [MelodyComposer](https://your-username.github.io/MelodyComposer) (replace with your deployed URL).
- Alternatively, run the app locally by following the setup instructions below.

### 2. Compose a Melody
- Use the virtual piano to play notes, or load a preloaded example.
- Adjust durations (whole, half, quarter, etc.) and add rests as needed.
- Preview your melody with the "Play Melody" button.

### 3. Generate Arduino Code
- Click "Generate Code" to create Arduino code for your melody.
- Copy the code and add the required `NOTE_` frequency definitions (e.g., `#define NOTE_C4 262`).

### 4. Play on Your Arduino
- Connect a buzzer to your Arduino (default pin: 9).
- Upload the code using the Arduino IDE and enjoy your melody!
