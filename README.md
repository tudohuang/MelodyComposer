# Melody Composer

## Project Overview
Melody Composer is a desktop application built with Electron, designed for Arduino enthusiasts and music creators. It offers a visual interface that mimics playing a piano, allowing users to intuitively compose melodies and generate code compatible with Arduino buzzers. No advanced programming skills are required—just click to create music for your buzzer projects! Check out our [example website](https://melody-composer.netlify.app/) to explore the creation process or view sample code.

### Key Features
- **Visual Composition**: Input notes and rhythms with a piano-like interface by simply clicking.
- **Arduino Buzzer Support**: Automatically generates code ready for Arduino buzzers.
- **Portable Mode**: No installation needed—extract and run, perfect for portability and sharing.
- **Example Website**: Showcases creation examples and Arduino application tutorials.
